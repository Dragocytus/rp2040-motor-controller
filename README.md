# rp2040-motor-controller
A dual channel brushless motor controller based on the RP2040 microcontroller

The boards cost between $15 and $40 each depending on version and quantity.
```
NOTE: This design is still changing. There is currently one board version in
this repo. This is our dual CPU version with CAN bus and extra connectors for
our robot. This version also improves the current measurement circuit compared
to the first rev.

Once we have verified the improved current measurement circuit, we will also
support a single CPU version which is smaller and slightly cheaper. This will
look similar to our first prototype version shown in the top of the photo at the
bottom of this document. To view the files for that board see this commit:

```
Our dream is that you will fab your own boards, make changes, and share your work - giving this design life beyond our efforts.

Designed by Taylor Alexander for Twisted Fields, for the Acorn Precision Farming Rover.
