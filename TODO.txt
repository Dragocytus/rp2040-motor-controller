2023 AFTER PRODUCTION NOTES

rearrange debug connector to match default rp2040 debug pinout?

- add additional filter capacitor pads, maybe 0806 for easy soldering

- fix connector orientation - see if possible to fix output orientation in file
- NOTE: connector silk rectangle is not appropriately centered, and this might explain
- why they were stuffed backwards. outline only lines up when stuffed backwards. this also risks clearance issues

- invert LED buffers - C2652101 - actually just reversed LEDs

make GND test point farther from nearby capacitor so shorting of probe is less likely

- maybe make GND test point bigger

- consider dimmer LEDs at least for always on power LED, or a system to switch LED voltage

- when I run a motor hard and then stop it, I hear an electronic pop on the board (once). is this a diode blowing out? what do I need for braking?

- motor capacitors - some ceramic caps are only 50V!

- motor flyback diodes - I popped a diode! need higher power capability. Also on layout, should lay out diodes for low inductance - short traces.

- DIP switch for CAN address! - will use smt jumpers to save space

- DIP https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/DIP-Switches_DongGuan-KINGTEK-Industrial-Co-LTD-DSHP04TSGET_C40736.html
- last one can be for LED brightness
- switch LEDs to 2.5v

- add direct connection between CPUs for E-stop

- any way to flash both processors at once? - looks like a custom bootloader could be possible.

add test points on the bottom of the board sufficient for functional test

- add more protection for CAN bus lines - TVS diodes or something.

- during layout, make sure to use low inductance traces to TVS diodes

- consider what happens if a sensor shorts out due to corrosion. 3.3v should have some short protection, either with a thermal fuse or
- the switching power supply with short detection could be used

- can bus termination on a DIP switch instead of solder jumper? field changes to the system not possible with solder only jumper

- DIP switches for more things. imagine you are walking out to repair a broken robot in the field. you want to be able to configure it for any corner without solder.

six pin connectors for encoders to include thermistor!

Consider dual FETS of these for super high current:

use a voltage divider shunt to allow for smaller inline current sense. - 10% of current goes through shunt. precision not required, can be calibrated.

Add a fan controller FET, including holes for a 24v converter add on
